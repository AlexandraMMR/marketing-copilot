# Problem Exploration Document: Product Marketing for the Inexperienced

## 1. Problem Statement

**How might we** create an approachable, step-by-step system that allows a product builder with no prior experience in product marketing or content creation to effectively launch, promote, and sustain awareness for their digital product?

## 2. Goal

The goal of this exercise is to define and explore a problem that can be solved with a digital solution. The problem selected—marketing a product without experience—is ideally suited for a digital solution. The final product could be a SaaS (Software as a Service) tool, a dedicated learning platform, or an interactive web application that guides the user through the marketing process.

> **Solution Concept:** A "Marketing Copilot" app that breaks down the product marketing journey into small, manageable, template-driven tasks, complete with AI-assisted content generation prompts for content and assets, as well as a clear execution checklist.

## 3. Exploring the Problem

Digging into the "why" and "what if" behind the problem statement:

| Question | Exploration and Idea Generation |
| --- | --- |
| **What would I try if it was okay to fail?** | I would launch a "Minimal Viable Marketing (MVM)" challenge. A 7-day sprint where the user only does two things: 1) Talk to 5 potential customers, and 2) Post one piece of valuable content. |
| **How can I rephrase this as a goal?** | **Goal:** To convert the overwhelming process of marketing into a series of small, achievable, and repeatable actions that build confidence and produce measurable results. |
| **Where does my thinking differ?** | Others focus on tools (e.g., "Use ChatGPT"). I focus on **psychology and process**. The core problem is lack of clarity and fear of failure, not just a lack of tools. |
| **If nothing was in my way, what’s next?** | Build a fully automated, end-to-end marketing template generator. Answer 5 questions and get a 90-day plan, email sequences, and target profiles instantly. |
| **How would a competitor deal with this?** | A competitor would offer massive amounts of info (video lessons/e-books). My approach is **action-oriented and minimalist** (10-min tutorial + forced action). |
| **Explaining to an old friend?** | "I'm building a map for creators who suck at marketing. It tells you exactly: 1) Who to talk to, 2) What to say, and 3) Where to say it. Just follow the arrows." |
| **Imagine it’s five years from now?** | The "Marketing copilot" app is the standard onboarding tool for indie hackers, having demystified the launch process through guided steps. |
| **Solve it with infinite money?** | Hire the world’s best strategists to build an AI "Chief Marketing Officer" that learns the user's personality and niche to develop a unique, authentic voice. |

## 4. Solution Ideation and Brainstorming

The solution should not be another resource library, but a **do-it-yourself guide and generator**.

* **Marketing Recipe Book:** Specific "recipes" (e.g., "The Pre-Launch Hype Recipe") with ingredients, steps, and expected outcomes.
* **Content Conversion Tool:** Solve the bottleneck by repurposing one core insight into posts for X, LinkedIn, and Email scripts.

## 5. Feature Deep-Dive

### Feature 1: The "Marketing Recipe Book"

This acts as the **strategic layer**. It provides the user with a clear, proven sequence of tasks, eliminating guesswork.

| Area | Question | Specification for Digital Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Recipe Structure** | What are the essential components? | Title, Goal, Ingredients (Prerequisites), Steps (Checklist), and "Don't Forget" tips. |
| **Types of Recipes** | What are common needs? | Pre-Launch Hype, First Sales Funnel, Early Content Strategy, and Validation Loops. |
| **Simplicity** | How to ensure steps are simple? | Each "Step" must be a micro-task (<30 mins). Complex steps link directly to the Content Conversion Tool. |
| **Tracking** | How does the user know they're done? | A gamified checklist. Completing one recipe unlocks the next logical stage in the journey. |

### Feature 2: The "Content Conversion Tool"

This acts as the **execution layer**. It allows a user to maximize output from a single high-value insight.

| Area | Question | Specification for Digital Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Input Mechanism** | What is the simplest input? | A "Core Message" text field or prompt: "What is the #1 problem your product solves?" |
| **Output Formats** | What are the crucial channels? | **Twitter/X:** Threads/Hooks; **LinkedIn:** Value posts; **Email:** 3-sentence updates; **Video:** 60s script outlines. |
| **Authenticity** | How to avoid sounding robotic? | Provide structured templates/prompts where the user fills in the human element (e.g., "Describe the user's frustration"). |
| **Integration** | How does this integrate with recipes? | Recipe steps (e.g., "Write Launch Email") include a button to pre-populate the Conversion Tool with the required format. |

## Conclusion

The **Marketing copilot** addresses the two most paralyzing aspects of marketing through:

1. **The Recipe Book:** Providing the map and direction.
2. **The Content Conversion Tool:** Providing the fuel and vehicle for the journey.
