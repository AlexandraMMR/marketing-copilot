# UX Research (Persona, Stories, Scenarios) 

## Purpose

The purpose of the Marketing Copilot is to act as a "GPS for the inexperienced marketer." It aims to bridge the gap between having a finished product and knowing how to successfully bring it to market. By combining strategic roadmaps (Recipes) with an execution engine (AI Content Tool), the product empowers non-marketers to execute professional-grade campaigns in under 30 minutes a day.

## Problem statement
How might we create an approachable, step-by-step system that allows a product builder with no prior experience in marketing to effectively launch, promote, and sustain awareness for their digital product without being paralyzed by "The Blank Page" or decision fatigue?

## Target audience personas
Our research identifies three distinct customer personas:
1. Alex (The Solo Builder): A developer who views marketing as a distraction. He needs speed, automation, and checklists to spend less than 5 hours a week on promotion.
2. Sarah (The Small Business Transitioner): A traditional owner moving digital. She suffers from jargon overload (SEO, ROI) and needs a structured system to build brand confidence.
3. Dr. Elena (The Subject Matter Expert): A professional with deep knowledge but no design skill. She needs to "atomize" long-form expertise into engaging, high-authority social media posts.

## Scenarios

### Scenario A: The Pre-Launch Panic (Persona: Alex, The Indie Hacker)
 * **Context**: It is Thursday. Alex is launching his SaaS, CodeFlow, on Monday. He has spent 8 months on code and 0 minutes on marketing. He is paralyzed by the "blank page" and fears looking unprofessional.
 * **Action**: Alex opens the app and selects the "7-Day Pre-Launch Hype" Recipe. He sees a checklist that tells him today's task is "Generate 3 Social Hooks."
 * **Flow**: He clicks the task, which opens the Content Conversion Tool. He enters his product’s value proposition. The AI generates three distinct drafts (a curiosity gap, a data-driven post, and a direct CTA).
 * **Outcome**: Within 20 minutes, Alex has scheduled his posts. His anxiety drops because he no longer has to "invent" marketing; he just has to "approve" it.

### Scenario B: The Digital Transition (Persona: Sarah, The Small Business Transitioner)
 * **Context**: Sarah owns a local boutique and is moving her sales online for the first time. She is intimidated by marketing jargon like "SEO" and "Conversion," and she worries that her digital presence will feel "inauthentic" or stiff compared to her in-person customer service.
 * **Action**: Sarah opens the app and selects the "First Online Sale" Recipe. She sees a checklist that breaks down her digital launch into simple steps, starting with today’s task: "Draft a Multi-Channel Launch Announcement."
 * **Flow**: She clicks the task to open the Content Conversion Tool. She selects her preferred "Warm & Community-focused" brand voice and enters her core message about her new floral spring collection. The AI generates a heartfelt Facebook post for her local fans and a professional email update for her newsletter.
 * Outcome: Within 20 minutes, Sarah has her entire week of launch content ready. Her confidence grows because the tool used plain language and kept her authentic voice, allowing her to focus on fulfilling orders instead of decoding marketing terminology.

### Scenario C: The Knowledge Atomization (Persona: Dr. Elena, The SME)
 * **Context**: Elena has a 40-page whitepaper on executive leadership. She knows it contains gold, but she doesn't know how to make it "social-media friendly" or visually appealing.
 * **Action**: Elena selects the "Authority Builder" Recipe. The system prompts her to add her text.
 * **Flow**: The Execution Engine extracts 5 key insights. Elena selects generate Linkedin post, then goes to PostMagic to brainstorm visual ideas for the post, maybe a carousel.
 * **Outcome**: Elena has a high-authority LinkedIn carousel and post that looks like it was made by an expert, maintaining her professional reputation with minimal effort.
